<p>y name is Yohan Le Gars and I am a french software robotics student specializing in machine perception and computer vision. I currently live in the Netherlands where I study my master at TU Delft. I gotta say that I ended up studying robotics by inadvertance as I was not intially drawn to engineering and computers in general. But recently the field of cognitive robotics has been growing on me and now I am working hard
to become a competent engineer in this field in order to play a role in shaping the society of tomorrow. Outside of the engineering world, I like to play various sports activities. I grew up playing golf, tennis and football. Every day I strive to be a good friend to my family and friends.</p>

<p>I will leave you with a french motto that was given by my uncle: Bosses à fond et après accélères!</p>
