<p>
A Kinova arm is mounted on a Husky mobile robot. The robot arm carries a camera to monitor manufacturing processes that operators cannot get too close to for safety reasons. The software solution provides a graphical user interface that allows the operator to choose the 2D positions (waypoints) the Husky needs to reach and the 3D points the operator wants to look at (points of interest) via the camera direct recording. The positions of the waypoints and points of interest can be directly handled in Rviz.
