Both RRT and RRT* single query path planning algorithms were implemented for a mobile robot in a parking lot scenario without the use of a planner module, and investigated. A PD controller allows the robot, represented by a kinematic bicycle model, to follow the computed path. The simulation was done using Pygame.
